### Paper Title: 
Blind 3D Video Stabilization with Spatio-Temporally Varying Motion Blur
### Abstract: 
Video stabilization compensates for frame shake during acquisition. Existing 3D methods model perspective through data-driven training or motion estimation. Yet, they struggle with shaky videos featuring abrupt movements, leading to local motion blur. This is common in real-world scenes with blind motion. Combining stabilization and deblurring faces challenges as motion blur intensity changes continuously. The direct method lacks spatio-temporal information, hindering cross-frame compensation. Our Cross-frame-temporal Network addresses blind motion blur, utilizing cross-frame temporal features. It includes a Blur Transform Block (BTBlock) for spatially varying motion blur, adapting to non-uniform effects. Our Temporal-aware Network (TANet) further suppresses motion blur. Limited pair-training data with motion blur hinders practical application. Our method, employing an un-pretrained in-test strategy, surpasses state-of-the-art methods, as shown in extensive experiments.
